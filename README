setup-requires
==============

An example of a working build-system requires implementation. For those
times when your setup.py needs to import a dependency.

Use
===

This package should not be installed! Instead, prepend setup-requires'
setup.py to your own.  List only the requirements setup.py itself needs
to run in pyproject.toml::

    # Example build requirements folling build-deps-pep
    [build-system]
    requires = ["cffi", "pycparser >= 2.10"]

(Only the name and required versions are allowed, not the full pip
syntax of URLs to specific repositories.  Instead, install internal
setup-requires dependencies manually or set PIP_FIND_LINKS=... to point
to the necessary repositories.)

When run, setup-requires' setup.py checks that each distribution listed is
installed; if not, it installs them into the ./setup-requires directory
in a pip subprocess. The normal setup.py contents can simply be pasted
below the bootstrap code.
