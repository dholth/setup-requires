setup-requires
==============

An example of a working setup_requires = [...] implementation. For those
times when your setup.py needs to import a dependency.

Use
===

This package should not be installed! Instead, rename your project's
setup.py to real-setup.py, copying setup-requires' setup.py in its
place. List only the requirements setup.py itself needs to run in the
`setup-requires =` key of the `[metadata]` section of setup.cfg,
one per line::

    [metadata]
    setup-requires = cffi
        pip
        pycparser >= 2.10

(Only the name and required versions are allowed, not the full pip
syntax of URLs to specific repositories. Instead, install internal
setup-requires dependencies manually or set PIP_FIND_LINKS=... to point
to the necessary repositories.)

When run, setup-requires' setup.py checks that each distribution
listed in setup-requires is installed; if not, it installs them into
the ./setup-requires directory in a pip subprocess. Then real-setup.py
continues to execute with the same arguments.
